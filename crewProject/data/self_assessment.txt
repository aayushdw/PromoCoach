# Self Assessment - Sarah Johnson
# Performance Review: Q4 2024

## Technical Achievements

### Major Accomplishments
This year has been incredibly rewarding from a technical perspective. I'm proud of leading the microservices migration project, which was a complex undertaking that required careful planning and execution. The project successfully reduced system latency by 40% and improved our overall system reliability. I also implemented an automated testing framework that increased our code coverage to 85%, which has significantly improved our team's confidence in deployments.

### Technical Growth
I've deepened my expertise in microservices architecture, system design, and performance optimization. Working on the API redesign project gave me valuable experience in designing systems that can handle high-scale traffic (1M+ requests daily). I've also improved my skills in database optimization and caching strategies.

### Areas of Technical Interest
I'm particularly interested in exploring event-driven architectures and distributed systems. I'd like to gain more experience with machine learning integration and real-time data processing. I'm also excited about the potential of implementing more advanced monitoring and observability tools.

## Leadership and Mentoring

### Mentoring Experience
Mentoring Jennifer and Michael has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my role this year. Seeing their growth and confidence improve has been incredibly rewarding. I've learned that effective mentoring involves not just teaching technical skills, but also helping mentees develop problem-solving approaches and confidence in their abilities.

### Leadership Opportunities
I've taken on more leadership responsibilities this year, particularly in technical decision-making and project planning. I've learned the importance of considering multiple perspectives and balancing technical excellence with business needs. I'm interested in taking on even more strategic responsibilities.
